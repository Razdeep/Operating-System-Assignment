 * ---------------
 * 
 * Question 
 * 
 * A university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) 
 * who helps undergraduate students with their programming assignments 
 * during regular office hours. The TAâ€™s office is rather small and has 
 * room for only one desk with a chair and computer. There are three chairs
 * in the hallway outside the office where students can sit and wait if 
 * the TA is currently helping another student. When there are no students 
 * who need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap.
 * If a student arrives during office hours and finds the TA sleeping,
 * the student must awaken the TA to ask for help. If a student arrives 
 * and finds the TA currently helping another student, the student sits on 
 * one of the chairs in the hallway and waits. If no chairs are available, 
 * the student will come back at a later time.
